## Development

Because the nature of how template boilerplates are generated, we generate `yarn.lock` files inside of nested packages so we can fix versions to avoid non-deterministic installations.

When adding packages, yarn workspaces will use the root `yarn.lock`. It could be ideal to remove it while adding packages, and when publishing or pushing new changes, generating the nested lock files.

In the root, to remove all nested lock files:

```
yarn locks:remove
```

When you need to remove/generate locks for all nested packages, simply run `yarn locks` in the root:

```
yarn locks
```
